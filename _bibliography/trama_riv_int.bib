abstract={The industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) paradigm represents an attractive opportunity for new generation measurement applications, which are increasingly based on efficient and reliable communication systems to allow the extensive availability of continuous data from instruments and/or sensors, thus enabling real-time measurement analysis. Nevertheless, different communication systems and heterogeneous sensors and acquisition systems may be found in an IIoT-enabled measurement application, so that solutions need to be defined to tackle the issue of seamless, effective, and low-latency interoperability. A significant and appropriate solution is the open platform communications (OPCs) unified architecture (UA) protocol, thanks to its object-oriented structure that allows a complete contextualization of the information. The intrinsic complexity of OPC UA, however, imposes meaningful performance assessment to evaluate its suitability in the aforementioned context. To this aim, this article presents the design of a general yet accurate and reproducible measurement setup that will be exploited to assess the performance of the main open-source implementations of OPC UA. The final goal of this work is to provide a characterization of the impact of this protocol stack in an IIoT-enabled measurement system, in particular, in terms of both the latency introduced in the measurement process and the power consumption. © 1963-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={In this article, we investigate an innovative solution, to implement high sampling frequency industrial control by means of networked embedded systems connected via WiFi. The basic idea relies on a co-design approach for the control application, which is then able to adapt its sampling period, as well as to tune the Wi-Fi parameters, according to the feedback coming from the network. To this end, we implemented a cross-layer architecture acting at both application and data-link layers, which features a robust frame-delay state estimator, a time-efficient communication policy, and a specific tuning of the critical protocol parameters. Suitable hardware-in-the-loop experiments have been carried out exploiting two different embedded systems available off-the-shelf. The preliminary results, obtained from an extensive experimental campaign, are encouraging since they show that the proposed architecture enables industrial control applications requiring a sampling rate up to 1000 Hz, even in presence of communication impairments. © 2005-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Factory automation systems based on the IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi standard may benefit from its Multi-Rate Support (MRS) feature, which allows for dynamically selecting the most suitable transmission rate for the targeted application context. The MRS is implemented by means of rate adaptation algorithms (RAAs), which has already demonstrated to be effective to improve both timeliness and reliability, which are typically strict requirements of industrial real-time communication systems. Indeed, some of such algorithms have been specifically conceived for reliable real-time communications. However, the computational complexity of such algorithms has not been effectively investigated yet. In this paper, we address such an issue, particularly focusing on the execution times of some specific rate adaptation algorithms, as well as on their impact on the automation tasks. In this respect, after a formal description of the algorithms, we present the outcomes of an extensive experimental session, which includes practical measurements and realistic simulations. The obtained results are encouraging, since the measured execution times indicate that rate adaptation algorithms can be profitably adopted by industrial automation systems, allowing for improving their reliability and timeliness without impacting on the overall performance. © 2020 by the authors.

abstract={This work studies the problem of LQG control when the link between the sensor and the controller relies on a Wi-Fi network. Unfortunately, the communication on a wireless medium is sensitive to noise in the transmission band, which is characterized by the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). Wi-Fi allows to switch among different bit-rates in real-time thus permitting to trade-off lower loss probabilities for larger latency or vice-versa to achieve better closed-loop performance. To exploit this feature, under a constant SNR scenario, we propose a cross-layer approach where the bit-rate is optimally selected based on a control performance metric (i.e. minimum LQG cost) and a model-based controller is used to compensate for the packet losses. Under time-varying SNR, we additionally propose a (sub-optimal) on-line rate adaptation strategy and we guarantee the closed-loop stability under some mild conditions. Numerical comparisons with emulation-based approaches using TrueTime, a realistic Matlab-based Wi-Fi simulator, are included to show the benefits of the adaptive approach under time-varying SNR scenarios. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},
