abstract={In this paper we consider an Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) system, based on the production of 3D-printed artifacts that are equipped with embedded sensors to monitor some environmental variables such as temperature, humidity, etc. These sensors allow to gather information during the production phase of the artifacts, as well as while they are deployed in their final locations, so that diverse operations (e.g. tuning of the production parameters, predictive maintenance, environmental monitoring) can be undertaken. Monitoring is implemented via LoRaWAN, a Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) that allows to acquire data from the sensors embedded in the artifacts. After a description of the IIoT system, we provide the description of some experimental tests we carried out in this challenging context, aimed at investigating both the reliability of the transmission and the battery life time. The outcomes of such experiments indicate the actual feasibility of the proposed technique. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={Modern industrial manufacturing plants, especially those using coordinated electrical drives with strict timing requirements, make extensive use of real-time communication networks. These systems, typically, are based on various topologies, include diverse protocols, and connect devices from different manufacturers, which may make them difficult to study, plan and optimize. As a solution, the adoption of digital twins allows to simulate such systems under various operating conditions in a low-cost and zero-risk environment. In this paper we address the digital twin of a networked electrical drive system, focusing on the real-time communication network used to connect the drives. In particular, we describe the simulation model of Profinet IO RT Class 1, implemented as an extension of the INET library of OMNeT++. Moreover, we present the outcomes of the tests carried out on a prototype simulated network and compare them with those of the equivalent real one. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={Wireless technologies play a key role in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) scenario, for the development of increasingly flexible and interconnected factory systems. Wi-Fi remains particularly attracting due to its pervasiveness and high achievable data rates. Furthermore, its Rate Adaptation (RA) capabilities make it suitable to the harsh industrial environments, provided that specifically designed RA algorithms are deployed. To this aim, this paper proposes to exploit Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques to design an industry-specific RA algorithm. The RL is spreading in many fields since it allows to design intelligent systems by means of a stochastic discrete-time system based approach. In this work we propose to enhance the Robust Rate Adaptation Algorithm (RRAA) by means of a RL approach. The preliminary assessment of the designed RA algorithm is carried out through meaningful OMNeT++ simulations, that allow to recognize the beneficial impact of the introduction of RL with respect to several industry-specific performance indicators. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={The Industrial IoT scenario represents an interesting opportunity for distributed measurements systems, that are typically based on efficient and reliable communication systems, as well as the widespread availability of data from measurement instruments and/or sensors. The Open Platform Communications (OPC) Unified Architecture (UA) protocol is designed to ensure interoperability between heterogeneous sensors and acquisition systems, given its object-oriented structure allowing a complete contextualization of the information. Stemming from the intrinsic complexity of OPC UA, we designed an experimental measurement setup to carry out a meaningful performance assessment of its main open source implementations. The aim is to characterize the impact of the adoption of this protocol stack in a DMS in terms of both latency and power consumption, and to provide a general yet accurate and reproducible measurement setup. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={The continuous evolution of additive manufacturing allows to produce innovative objects that are adopted in several diverse fields of applications. This trend can be further enhanced by the spreading of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) paradigm which ensures effective interconnection among distributed, possibly heterogeneous, components and allows remote access by means of commercial devices such as PCs, tablets and smartphones. In this paper, we address a large additive manufacturing project which effectively exploits an IIoT architecture by embedding sensors (temperature, humidity, light, etc.) within the produced artifacts, so that they can make available diverse measurement data collected during both the production process (in real-time) and the subsequent lifetime of the artifacts, enabling further off-line analyses. This clearly represents an innovative and challenging feature that needs to be adequately investigated. To this regard, after describing the automation system of the project, we focus on the wireless system that implements the collection of measurements by the sensors within the artifacts. The design process led to the selection of a Low Power Wide Area Network, namely LoRaWAN, as a suitable communication solution. In this respect, we present here the tests performed to assess the actual feasibility and performance of such network in this specific application context. The obtained results are encouraging, since the sensors within the artifacts revealed able to exchange the required measurement data with the automation system in an effective way. © 2020 IEEE.},
