I teach in two different insitutions, the _University of Modena and Reggio Emilia_ (**UniMoRe**) and the _Alma Mater Studiorum---University of Bologna_ (**UniBO**).

For _UniMoRe_ I am responsible of the course [Industrial Measurements](http://personale.unimore.it/rubrica/contenutiad/tramarin/2020/63835/N0/N0/9999) and I co-teach the course [Misure Elettroniche e Laboratorio](http://personale.unimore.it/rubrica/contenutiad/tramarin/2020/57517/N0/N0/9999) (together with [Luigi Rovati](https://personale.unimore.it/rubrica/dettaglio/lrovati)).

For _UniBO_ I am responsible for the course [Advanced Sensors for Electric Vehicles](https://www.unibo.it/en/teaching/course-unit-catalogue/course-unit/2020/455959).
