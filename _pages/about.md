I am an Associate Professor of _Instrumentation and Measurements_ at the ["Enzo Ferrari" Engineering Department](https://www.ingmo.unimore.it/site/home.html) of the [University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Italy](https://www.unimore.it/). 

Previously, I have been an Assistant Professor of _Computer Science_ at the [Department of Management and Engineering](http://www.gest.unipd.it/en?set_language=en) at the University of Padova, Italy.

I have been also with the [National Research Council of Italy (CNR)](https://www.cnr.it/), and particularly with the [Institute of Electronics and Computer and Telecommunications (IEIIT)](https://www.ieiit.cnr.it/) from 2013 to 2018, where I held a post-doctoral position.

I received the Dr. Eng. degree in Electronic Engineering ('08) and the Ph.D. degree in Information Engineering ('12) from the [University of Padova, Italy](http://www.unipd.it).

My main research fields of interest are performance analysis and measurements on network systems, with particular focus on industrial real-time wired / wireless communications, and on cyber-physical systems. My interdisciplinary research profile includes expertise in real-time embedded systems, real-time ethernet solutions, Time Sensitive Networks (TSN) and Internet of Things.

I am a member of the [IEEE](https://www.ieee.org/) since 2008, and in particular of the 
[Industrial Electronics Society (IES)](http://www.ieee-ies.org/) and the [Instrumentation and Measurements Society](https://ieee-ims.org/). I have also been involved in the standardization activities of the IEEE 61158 standard for industrial hard real-time communication.

I am also a member of the [Italian Group of Electrical and Electronic Measurements (GMEE)](https://www.gmee.org/).

<!-- IEEE Industrial Electronics Society (IES) Technical Committee on Factory Automation committee since 2013 and of Instrumentation and Measure-ment Society TC-37 since 2016.  -->

I am currently in the Editorial Board of several renowned international journals, and also serves in the Program Committee of several IEEE-organized international conferences, including I2MTC, M&N, ETFA and INDIN.
